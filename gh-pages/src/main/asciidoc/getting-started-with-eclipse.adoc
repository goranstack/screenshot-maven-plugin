 . Select create links when prompted by Eclipse

 . Right click on the `screenshot-maven-plugin` folder in Eclipse Package Explorer and
 Import... -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.
 Press the Next button

Your Eclipse workspace should now be populated with the modules of the `screenshot-maven-plugin`
project. The dependency jars should be automatically downloaded by Maven.
